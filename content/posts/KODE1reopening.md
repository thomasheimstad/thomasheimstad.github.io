## Event coordination, logistics, speech proposals and VIP-guestlist

In 2017, KODE reopened one of it's museum buildings in the heart of Bergen, which had undergone large renovations for several years. The event was tagged as one of the most important cultural events in Norway in 2017, and I had the responsibility of creating the opening event.

The VIP guest list: Queen Sonja of Norway, exhibiting the first temporary art exhibition in the newly renovated museum. The Prime Minister, performing the opening speech declaring the museum for reopened. The Minister of Trade and the Mayor of Bergen, both with speeches about the important collaborations which enabled financing and project completion.

The opening event was split in two. The first section a closed arrangement for the collaborators and contributors, the second the public opening.

My assignment was multifold. I was in charge of the logistics, the event coordination and the programming for the event. In addition I was tasked with writing and coordinating talking points, security coordination, task listing staff training, minute scheduling and responsibility charts, supply coordination and artist booking.

The event went smoothly and according to plan. Over 1500 people visited the museum during the opening event.

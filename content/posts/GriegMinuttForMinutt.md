## 30 hours of live national TV

The idea of producing a live TV-broadcast of Edvard Grieg's complete musical production had circulated in the classical musical network in Norway for some time. 15 June 2018 was the date of Grieg's 175th anniversary, and the opportunity presented itself as a collaboration between NRK, the national broadcaster in Norway, the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra and KODE Edvard Grieg Museum.

In December 2017, KODE received the necessary funding by Sparebankstiftelsen DNB for artist booking and event production, and the first business days of 2018 consisted of creative meetings with NRK, BFO and KODE. It was exciting days, and the scope of the project was quickly established as one of the greatest single events in the museum's 90 year history.

My assignment was multifold. I was in charge of the digital project organization, using Microsoft Teams as the most important tool. I was involved in the artist programming, coordination with BFO and NRK, event coordination at Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen, logistics for artists, volunteers, drivers and staff, schedules for rehearsals and performances in collaboration with NRK, web development of the project website https://griegminuttforminutt.no, marketing coordination, and the creation of the main timeframe for the 30 hour live broadcast.

The project clocked in with just a 10 second discrepancy according to plan, a feat attributed to the slowTV-team of NRK, the meticulous timeframe planning and the error free production of all the concert venues.

## 2016-2020

In 2019 I was appointed director for The International Edvard Grieg Piano Competition, and together with the established project organization I continued the planning for the next competition edition.

Every second year, 30 international classical pianists come to Bergen to participate in this internationally acclaimed competition. It is a 10 day event which largely takes place at The Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen, and with the final concert with The Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. Volunteers, museum staff and external collaborators all contribute to make the competition a unique event for the participants, the jury members and the audience. The foundation Stiftelsen Kristian Gerhard Jebsen is main sponsor and sole private contributor to the event.

My tasks has been multifold during my different roles in the competition. As director, I had the privilege of representing the competition in the international network organizations such as the World Federation of International Music Competitions and the Alink-Argerich Foundation. I was in charge of the concept development, project budget, applications and reports, marketing strategy and the overall project planning and execution. As producer, I was hands on with logistics, coordination, production and project development and execution.

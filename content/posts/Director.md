## KODE Composer Homes & The International Edvard Grieg Piano Competition

Kode composer homes are three distinct and fascinating homes belonging to Ole Bull, Edvard Grieg and Harald Sæverud, with a generation span from 1810 to 1992. One of the museums, The Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen, is doubling as a top tourist destination in Bergen, with over 80.000 visitors per year, and greater parts of the generated revenue are from products tailored to the tourist industry.

The Grieg museum is also one of Norway’s most active classical concert venues with ca. 500 concerts annually. In addition to general museum and concert activities, the museum hosts one of the top international piano competitions in the world: The International Edvard Grieg Piano Competition. The museum director position doubles as director of the piano competition.

The dualism of being a cultural institution and a tourist destination offers a highly interesting combination of working culturally and commercially, with classical concerts as an integral part of the product.

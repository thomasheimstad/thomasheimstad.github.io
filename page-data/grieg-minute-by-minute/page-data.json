It was exciting days, and the scope of the project was quickly established as one of the greatest single events in the museum's 90 year history.</p>\n<p>My assignment was multifold. I was in charge of the digital project organization, using Microsoft Teams as the most important tool. I was involved in the artist programming, coordination with BFO and NRK, event coordination at Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen, logistics for artists, volunteers, drivers and staff, schedules for rehearsals and performances in collaboration with NRK, web development of the project website <a href=\"https://griegminuttforminutt.no\">https://griegminuttforminutt.no</a>, marketing coordination, and the creation of the main timeframe for the 30 hour live broadcast.</p>\n<p>The project clocked in with just a 10 second discrepancy according to plan, a feat attributed to the slowTV-team of NRK, the meticulous timeframe planning and the error free production of all the concert venues.</p>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"30 hours of live national TV The idea of producing a live TV-broadcast of Edvard Grieg's complete musical production had circulated in theâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Grieg Minute by Minute","firm":"KODE, NRK, Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra","department":"Project coordinator","img":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/d91f7/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg","base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.9083969465648856,"srcSet":"/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/b5282/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg 250w,\n/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/0a9c8/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg 500w,\n/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/d91f7/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg 1000w,\n/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/08276/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg 1500w,\n/static/99794b9bd6592221db6e64b6afb3431a/74fd5/GriegMinuttForMinutt.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}},"date":"15.06.2018","hired":null,"respons":"30 hour live TV-production. 600+ musicians, national broadcast and 700.000 viewers.","position":1,"category":"project","tags":["programming","project management","event coordination","producing","web development","logistics"]},"fields":{"slug":"/grieg-minute-by-minute","date":"2018-06-14T22:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/grieg-minute-by-minute","nexttitle":"Head of education","nextslug":"/head-of-education","prevtitle":"Producer","prevslug":"/producer"}}}

The event was tagged as one of the most important cultural events in Norway in 2017, and I had the responsibility of creating the opening event.</p>\n<p>The VIP guest list: Queen Sonja of Norway, exhibiting the first temporary art exhibition in the newly renovated museum. The Prime Minister, performing the opening speech declaring the museum for reopened.
